# bibtools

A set of tools for processing a reference database composed of bib files.

The package is built around the [bib file parser](https://github.com/aclements/biblib) of aclements.
Scripts are included for three common tasks: parsing downloaded bib files, searching the database, and creating project specific bibliographies.
